## Problem Statement

56% of gifters lament that they are stressed about gifting, a recent 2022 online survey on 2033 American consumers discovered [[1]](https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/holiday-gift-stressors/#Methodology). 28% and 24% of them respectively cited affordability and finding the right gift as the leading causes of gift stress. Whether it is for the holidays, special occasions or just an ordinary day, many resort to gift cards and cash when the overload of choices and factors ends up too overwhelming.

Corporations face similar pain points when it comes to gifting but on a larger scale. In the business world, gift-giving is often used to build relationships, show appreciation, and build brand loyalty. However, the pressure to find the right gift that represents the company's values and interests can be daunting. The process of researching, ordering and delivering gifts for clients, employees, and partners is time-consuming, logistically challenging and often ends up being repetitive and impersonal. As remote work continues to prevail post-Covid, corporate gifting shifted from a routine to a business priority and increased in frequency in order to motivate and retain employees [[2]](https://www.giftnow.com/assets/files/Unwrapping-the-American-Corporate-Gifting-Opportunity-Jun-29-2021.pdf).

Gifting can thus be stressful and challenging for individuals and corporations alike, often recurring year upon year. But it does not have to stay this way, here with Gyft.AI.
